    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "ans. Functions are advantageous because\n",
    "Organization -- As programs grow in complexity, having all the code live inside the main() function becomes                                 increasingly complicated. A function is almost like a mini-program that we can write separately from                       the main program, without having to think about the rest of the program while we write it. This allows                     us to reduce a complicated program into smaller, more manageable chunks, which reduces the overall                         complexity of our program.\n",
    "Reusability -- Once a function is written, it can be called multiple times from within the program. This avoids duplicated                code (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”) and minimizes the probability of copy/paste errors. Functions can also be                    shared with other programs, reducing the amount of code that has to be written from scratch (and retested)                  each time.\n",
    "Testing -- Because functions reduce code redundancy, there’s less code to test in the first place. Also because functions              are self-contained, once we’ve tested a function to ensure it works, we don’t need to test it again unless we              change it. This reduces the amount of code we have to test at one time, making it much easier to find bugs (or              avoid them in the first place).\n",
    "Extensibility -- When we need to extend our program to handle a case it didn’t handle before, functions allow us to make                    the change in one place and have that change take effect every time the function is called.\n",
    "Abstraction -- In order to use a function, you only need to know its name, inputs, outputs, and where it lives. You don’t                  need to know how it works, or what other code it’s dependent upon to use it. This lowers the amount of                      knowledge required to use other people’s code (including everything in the standard library).  "

A return statement consists of the return keyword followed by an optional return value. The     return value of a Python function can be any Python object. Everything in Python is an object.\n",

    "ans. 1. List- Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is a ordered collection of data. It is very               flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.\n",
    "     2.  Tuple- Just like list, tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between tuple                   and list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. It is represented                 by tuple class.\n",
    "     3. Dictionary- Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map,                       which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value                         pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a                           Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’."
